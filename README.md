# Drndić Lab Website

This is the source code for the [Drndić Lab Website](http://www.physics.upenn.edu/drndicgroup/).

![Screenshot](/../screenshots/drndiclab-website-screenshot.png?raw=true "Drndiclab Website Screenshot")

It is built with [Jekyll], a static-site generator, and uses [Foundation] as a responsive front-end framework.

Here are instructions for:

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Building and previewing the site](#building-and-previewing-the-site)
* [Making changes](#making-changes)

## Installation

### Dependencies

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

#### Jekyll

[Jekyll] is used for static site generation. Basically, you write your website using [Jekyll]'s formatting, and then use [Jekyll] to turn your simple code into the many pages of your website.

Note that Windows is **not** an officially supported platform, although instructions exist to help with the installation.

 * [Jekyll]'s [Jekyll on Windows page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation).
 * Julian Thilo's [Run Jekyll on Windows tutorial](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/).

Instructions for installing [Jekyll] can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), summarized below.

 1. [Install Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (Including development headers).
 2. [Install Ruby Gems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download), Ruby's package manager (probably ships with Ruby).
 3. [Install NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), the javascript runtime. Note that the node-sass package had a problem with node v0.12.x. It works fine with node v0.10.40.
 4. Install [Jekyll] (May need sudo).
```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

#### Foundation

[Foundation] is a responsive front-end framework. Basically, it comes with a bunch of CSS/SCSS styles that you can use to easly create sites that look good on both mobile and desktop environments.

Installation instructions are [here](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html) (see libsass version), and are summarized below.

1. [Foundation] uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage updates to [Foundation] and the third-party libraries that [Foundation] is built on.

  [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a Javascript task runner. We use it to automate compiling our SASS files to CSS.

  `npm` is the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.org/), and should come with your installation of [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) above.

  ```bash
$ npm install -g bower grunt-cli
  ```

2. Installing the Foundation CLI

  ```bash
$ gem install foundation
  ```

### Getting started with the source

First, clone the repo and move to the directory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/parkin/drndic-website.git
$ cd drndic-website
```

Next, install the node modules.

```bash
$ npm install
```

This should create the directory `node_modules` and populate it with the modules needed.

Then, install the bower components. Bower is used to to keep Foundation assets up to date within the project.

```bash
$ bower install
```
This should create the directory `bower_components` and populated it with the components needed.

Now, you should be ready to build the site.

## Building and previewing the site

[Jekyll] takes this website source code and builds the full html pages for the entire site, and sticks those pages by default in the `_site` directory. So, if you want to actually see the website or see any changes you make, you need to rebuild the site. There are three steps in this process.

1. Compile [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) files to CSS. This is done with [libsass](http://libsass.org/), and can be triggered with the following command. Note that at the moment, this only applies if you change any `.scss` file.

  ```bash
$ grunt build
  ```

2. Compile the website source using [Jekyll]. This takes the source code from this website and outputs the working website in the `_site` directory, by default. Use the command

  ```bash
$ jekyll build
  ```
3. To view the site, start a server that serves from the `_site` directory. There are many ways to do this, but one way is

  ```bash
$ jekyll serve
  ```

  from the project's root directory. Then open a browser and go to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

These commands have been packaged into a simple script, [serve.sh](serve.sh). Run this script with

```bash
$ ./serve.sh
```

and it will build the SASS files, the site, start the server, **and** watch for any source code changes and rebuild automatically if changes are detected.

## Making Changes

### Branches

The ***master*** branch is the main branch for working code. If you are developing a new feature, you should **not** use the ***master*** branch. Instead, create a new branch and work there, merge it back into master once you've tested your new feature.

The ***[publish](https://github.com/parkin/drndic-website/tree/publish)*** branch is where I keep the code for the website after it has been built by [Jekyll]. That name is reserved, **do not modify the** ***publish*** **branch**.

### Adding publication, news posts

In the folders [publications/_posts](publications/_posts), [news/_posts](news/_posts), you'll find Markdown files that are the current posts. In each folder, there is also a `.template` file that contains the base template needed to define a new post in that folder (eg [news/_posts/.template](news/_posts/.template). So, to create a new post, simply copy an old post or copy `.template`.

### Adding new members

Currently, the members are stored in a data YAML file, [_data/members.yml](_data/members.yml). To add new members, just edit the file, see the current formatting.

### Modifying the css

Currently, all of my css (it's actually sass) modifications are in [scss/_settings.scss](scss/_settings.scss). So make any style changes in [scss/_settings.scss](scss/_settings.scss) for now. This file is included in `scss/app.scss`, which gets compiled to `css/app.css` by a grunt task.

## TODO

- In [bower.json](bower.json), version 5.5.0 of foundation. breaks libsass support. (https://github.com/zurb/foundation/issues/5756). TODO remove specific version requirement once this is fixed.
