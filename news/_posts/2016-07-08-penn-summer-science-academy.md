This July, Prof. Drndic gave a research presentation to high school students from the Penn Summer Science Academy (PSSA). 
Roughly 40 students went on a tour of our lab, in coordination with Bill Berner, where they learned about the process of fabricating and testing a solid-state nanopore.
They also learned about the wide variety of techniques and instrumentation that we use: chemical vapor deposition, photolithography, electron beam nanosculpting, and DNA translocation experiments. 
More information about the Academy can be found here: <a href="http://www.physics.upenn.edu/~pssa/">http://www.physics.upenn.edu/~pssa/</a>.
